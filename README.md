# Algoritmeja (Algorithms)

A little collection where I'll try to create some simple implementations of the algorithms introduced on a course in the university of Turku as a part of preparing for the course's exam.

The course uses pseudocode and most courses in the university favour Java, so I decided to challenge myself with C++. I'll try to start off simple, avoiding things that take too much time to learn and don't benefit the course, at least until the exam is done.
